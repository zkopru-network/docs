# What is zkopru?

Zkopru is a layer-2 scaling solution for private transactions using zk-SNARK and optimistic rollup. It supports private transfer and private atomic swap within the layer-2 network between ETH, ERC20, ERC721 at a low cost. Also, with the pay-in-advance feature, users can withdraw assets from the layer-2 before the finalization.
